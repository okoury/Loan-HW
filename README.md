# 📚 3300 - Loan Calculator

A Python Flask web app for loan calculations. This is a basic Flask application using Jinja templates. The user enters details of their loan, and the app calculates the monthly payment and generates an amortization table.

This application is also used to teach CI/CD, including automated testing and GitHub Actions workflow files (.yaml).
